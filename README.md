## Description

**Dynamic APK** is an innovative app that allows users to install other apps temporarily on their devices. After use, the app will be automatically uninstalled, keeping your device clean and free from unwanted app leftovers.

This app is ideal for quick app testing, experimenting with new features, or avoiding the accumulation of apps on the device.

## Features

- **Temporary Installation**: Install apps on your device for a specified period.
- **Automatic Uninstallation**: After the defined time or use of the app, **Dynamic APK** automatically removes the installed app.
- **No Residue**: It does not leave unnecessary data or files after uninstallation.
- **Compatibility**: Supports installation of apps from Google Play or external APK files.

## How It Works

1. **Install Dynamic APK**: Download the app from the Play Store or from a trusted source.
2. **Select the App**: Choose the app you wish to install temporarily.
3. **Set the Time Period**: Decide how long the app will stay installed.
4. **Use the App**: Use the installed app as you would with a regular installation.
5. **Automatic Uninstallation**: After the set time or once the app is used, **Dynamic APK** will uninstall it automatically.

## Use Cases

- **Test New Apps**: Try out apps without commitment or the need for a permanent installation.
- **Avoid App Bloat**: Only install the apps you need for a short period, preventing unnecessary storage usage on your device.
- **Test Features**: Experiment with new app features without needing to keep the app installed permanently.
